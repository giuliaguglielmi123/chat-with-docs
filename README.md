# üíÅ Chatbot for Interacting with Your Books üìù
## Introduction

ü§ñ Welcome to my chatbot, a unique tool designed for engaging conversations with books. This chatbot leverages the OpenAI API to interact specifically with an amazing book, "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant." I used Streamlit to develop the graphical interface, Langchain for the QA chain, and Chroma as the vector database. While it's primarily tailored for books, you can easily adapt it to engage with various types of content.
