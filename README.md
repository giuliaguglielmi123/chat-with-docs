# üíÅ Chatbot for Interacting with Your Books üìù

## Introduction

ü§ñ Welcome to our chatbot designed to interact with books, offering a unique conversational experience. While it's tailored for books, you can easily adapt it to engage with various types of content.

## Features

1. Generates responses based on a book written by Naval Ravikant.
2. Allows users to provide feedback with a thumbs up or down.
3. Stores user feedback in a JSON file for historical analysis.
4. Implements chunk historicization to understand response limitations (e.g., why a certain answer was not known, or if there were issues with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation model).
5. Cites sources for the information provided in responses.

## Requirements

- OpenAI API key with access to Large Language Models.
