# üíÅ Chatbot for Interacting with Books and Documents üìù

## Introduction

ü§ñ Welcome to my interactive chatbot designed for engaging with books and documents. As an example, you'll find integrated in the docs an insightful book, "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant." This chatbot leverages Streamlit for its graphical interface, Langchain for the QA mechanism, and Chroma as the vector database.
